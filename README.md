PPoint_SlideSender
==================

This is a Visual Studio project to create a Windows Installer for a PowerPoint Add-in that allows you to email a set of selected slides from within a Presentation.

Once installed, you can select any number of slides from the Slide pane on the left, and then use the add-in to create a new email with a PowerPoint presentation attached that has the selected slides in it.
